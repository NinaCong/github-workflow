# Github Workflow and Setup
Each year, to allow Cherubs to program their own interactive graphics and site designs, we use Github to publish their work and embed it into our Wordpress site. This allows maximum flexibility, ease of editing, and the least probability of accidentally breaking the main Cherubs site.

## Overall Setup
- [Create a new team](https://github.com/orgs/medillcherubs/new-team) for this year's Cherubs. Name the team based on the current year, for example `Cherubs 2017`. Make the team secret. ([See teams from past years](https://github.com/orgs/medillcherubs/teams))
- [Create a second team](https://github.com/orgs/medillcherubs/new-team) for this year's CAs and Instructors, or anyone who will need admin access to every project for editing. Name the team something like `Cherubs 2017 Admin`. Make the team secret.

## Creating a Repo
When a Cherub is ready to put their work on Github, follow these procedures:
- Create a new repository and name it using this current year and their project slug. For example: `2016-cherub-timeline`.
- Create a new branch named `gh-pages`.
- Go to the repo settings, go to *Branches* and change the default branch to `gh-pages`. Still within the repo settings, go to *Collaborators and Teams* and add the Cherubs team you've just made as Read status, and the Admin team you've just made as Admin status.
